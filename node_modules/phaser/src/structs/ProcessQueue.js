>>>>>>> feature/New-menu-dev
 * The `pending` list is a selection of items which are due to be made 'active' in the next update.
 * The `active` list is a selection of items which are considered active and should be updated.
 * The `destroy` list is a selection of items that were active and are awaiting being destroyed in the next update.
 *
 * When new items are added to a Process Queue they are put in the pending list, rather than being added
 * immediately the active list. Equally, items that are removed are put into the destroy list, rather than
 * being destroyed immediately. This allows the Process Queue to carefully process each item at a specific, fixed
 * time, rather than at the time of the request from the API.
